# Jetson
Jetson is a bundle of Jetson utilities including JetWriter, JetReader, JetViewer, and more. Jetson was created by r6dev as a fun way to see how many file-based Java utilities could be packed into one thing.
## Made by developers, for developers
All Jetson utilities can be easily integrated into any of your Java projects, feel free to use any Jetson utility for any of your needs. Require a quick and easy file reader for your project? JetReader is there. Require a quick system-independent file viewer? JetViewer is there.
## How to use?
There are a lot of Jetson utilities and methods and you might not know where to start. [This documentation](https://github.com/r6dev/Jetson/wiki/Getting-started-with-Jetson-for-developers) could be a great start.
