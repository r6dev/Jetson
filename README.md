# Jetson
Jetson is a bundle of Jetson utilities including JetWriter, JetReader, JetViewer, and more. Jetson was created by RSIX as a fun way to see how many file-based Java utilities could be packed into one thing.
## Made by developers, for developers
All Jetson utilities can be easily integrated into any of your Java projects, feel free to any of them for any of your needs. Require a quick and easy file reader for your project? JetReader is there. Require a quick system-independent file viewer? JetViewer is there.
