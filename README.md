# rJToolbox
## Copier
### How to use
First download rJToolbox as a ZIP file, then open the builds directory and you will see the .jar file for copier. After finding the jar file, open cmd, then type "**java -jar [path to the jar file] [path to file you want to copy] [path to directory you want to paste it in]**" then press enter. 
P.S. if you don't have Java installed on your system, this wont work. You can install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
### Current problems
