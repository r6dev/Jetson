### Description
A **Java** program that duplicates a folder including its directories and files. This can be useful by other programs as a dll or api type of thing, though for that to happen someone would have to rework the source code to make it take arguments instead of reading input. The code took countless reiterations and headaches to get right (despite the idea and end result being so simple), but I got it in the end. Feel free to use this for your projects, though if you wish to redistribute it, proper credit would be appreciated. If you want the source, you can find it [here](https://github.com/rSIX-Developer/rJToolbox/blob/master/src/com/rsix/sB.java).
